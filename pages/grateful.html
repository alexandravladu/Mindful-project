                    <p> Gratitude is a positive emotion that involves being
                      thankful and appreciative and is associated with several
                      mental and physical health benefits. The word gratitude
                      can have a number of different meanings depending on how
                      others use it and in what context. </p>

                    <h3 class="feature-card"> Why do you feel it?</h3>
                    <p> When you experience gratitude, you feel grateful for
                      something or someone in your life and respond with
                      feelings of kindness, warmth, and other forms of
                      generosity. Gratitude is often a spontaneous emotion that
                      you feel in the moment. Some people are naturally prone to
                      experiencing it more often than others, but experts
                      suggest that it is also something that you can cultivate
                      and learn to practice more often.</p>
