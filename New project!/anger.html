  <h3 class="feature-card"> What is it?</h3>  
  <p> Anger is a core emotion that is experienced by all people. Typically triggered by an emotional hurt, anger is usually experienced as an unpleasant feeling that occurs when we think we have been injured, mistreated, opposed in our long-held views, or when we are faced with obstacles that keep us from attaining personal goals.
    The experience of anger varies widely; how often anger occurs, how intensely it is felt, and how long it lasts are different for each person.

  <h3 class="feature-card"> Why do you feel it?</h3>  
  <p> Anger rarely feels good and often has a destructive element to it as well.
    Anger can be a way of not directly experiencing the pain that caused us to react, and doing so can be done consciously or unconsciously.
    It can distract us from the pain we are feeling by shifting from self-focus (pain) to other-focus (what caused it).
    Anger can also help keep us from feeling vulnerable or scared by getting angry instead.

  <h3 class="feature-card"> How do you calm down?</h3>  
 <p>✪ Take a deep breath. Breathing deeply and slowly triggers the body to stop releasing stress hormones and start to relax.</p>
<p>✪ Meditate.</p>
<p>✪ Cognitive restructuring and journaling to change the way you express your anger.</p>
<p>✪ Problem solving and communication.</p>
<p> ✪ Talk to someone you trust and/or a therapist!</p>
