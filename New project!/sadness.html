  <h3 class="feature-card"> Why do you feel it?</h3>  
  <p>Sadness also serves a personal function. It moves one’s attention and focus towards the self, motivating them to evaluate their priorities. This is related to the motivational functional of sadness mentioned above. An evaluation of one’s wants and goals often follows sadness, as there is a tendency to be aversive to the emotion. It can signal that something is not right, that a current circumstance or situation is not serving one's interests, and that one's behaviours and motivations should be re-assessed.</p>
